# Abandoned-Task-Controlling
A tracking solution to meet CR target

## Business Context
This project simulates a workforce planning and decision-support system designed for a large-scale operational environment with fluctuating demand and strict service level requirements.

---

## Problem Statement
Operations leaders need to balance service level targets, labor cost, and workforce availability while dealing with demand uncertainty, productivity variation, and hiring constraints.

---

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Limited hiring speed  
- Productivity varies by experience level  
- Fixed shift structures and labor rules  
- Cost sensitivity during peak periods  

> All numbers and logic are abstracted to respect confidentiality.

---

## Approach (High-level)
- Volume forecasting and demand normalization  
- Capacity modeling using productivity and shrinkage assumptions  
- Headcount and cost projection  
- Scenario-based simulation for decision support  

---

## Key Decisions Supported
- How many people to hire and when  
- Shift mix and staffing distribution  
- Cost vs SLA trade-offs  
- Risk identification during peak periods  

---

## Outcome & Impact
The model enables leadership to evaluate multiple operational scenarios quickly and make informed decisions that balance service performance and cost efficiency.

---

## What I Would Improve in a Real Deployment
- Integrate real-time performance feedback  
- Add probabilistic risk modeling  
- Enhance visualization for non-technical stakeholders  

---
